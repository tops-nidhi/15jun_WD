Variable:-
variable is like a container where we can store the value.
- Variable name must start with letter or underscore and cannot contain any special character other than underscores, digits(0 to 9)and letters.

Define:-
1.Var
-> Can Reinitialize can also redefine.

2.Let
we use "let" keyword to define variable and assign it with some values, here x=10;
-> Can Reinitialize but can't redefine

3.Const
-> Can't Reinitialize also cannot redefine
